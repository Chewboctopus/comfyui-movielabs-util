        "Overview: This node will copy your files to the folder designated by the shot code and rename them appropriately and publish your file to shotgrid. If you publish something in error, please notify the production team on Slack. The incorrect version must be deleted from both ShotGrid and the F-drive before you attempt to publish again.\n\nArtist Login: Use the drop-down menu to select your email address.\n\nShot Code: Use the drop-down menu to pick the shot you are working on.\n\nOriginal Asset File Path: Copy the path to the file or folder and paste it here. You can also drag and drop the item directly onto this field.\n\nProxy Asset File Path: If you're submitting an EXR sequence, you must also submit an H.264 proxy in Rec. 709 color space. Paste the path to that file here. We are developing a feature to automate proxy creation and will provide an update when it's ready.\n\nNotes: You can add notes that will be passed to shotgrid here."
